Note that JavaCC defines lots of public classes, methods and fields that do not need to be public. These clutter the documentation. Sorry. NOTE : Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Flexible.Standard has an alternative queryparser that matches the syntax of this one, but is more modular, enabling substantial customization to how a query is created. Query Parser Syntax Overview Terms Fields Term Modifiers Wildcard Searches Regular expression Searches Fuzzy Searches Proximity Searches Range Searches Boosting a Term Boolean Operators OR AND + NOT - Grouping Field Grouping Escaping Special Characters Overview Although Lucene.NET provides the ability to create your own queries through its API, it also provides a rich query language through the Query Parser, a lexer which interprets a string into a Lucene.NET Query using JavaCC. Generally, the query parser syntax may change from release to release. This page describes the syntax as of the current release. If you are using a different version of Lucene.NET, please consult the copy of this document that was distributed with the version you are using. Before choosing to use the provided Query Parser, please consider the following: If you are programmatically generating a query string and then parsing it with the query parser then you should seriously consider building your queries directly with the query API. In other words, the query parser is designed for human-entered text, not for program-generated text. Untokenized fields are best added directly to queries, and not through the query parser. If a field's values are generated programmatically by the application, then so should query clauses for this field. An analyzer, which the query parser uses, is designed to convert human-entered text to terms. Program-generated values, like dates, keywords, etc., should be consistently program-generated. In a query form, fields which are general text should use the query parser. All others, such as date ranges, keywords, etc. are better added directly through the query API. A field with a limit set of values, that can be specified with a pull-down menu should not be added to a query string which is subsequently parsed, but rather added as a TermQuery clause. Terms A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms: Single Terms and Phrases. A Single Term is a single word such as \"test\" or \"hello\". A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as \"hello dolly\". Multiple terms can be combined together with Boolean operators to form a more complex query (see below). Note: The analyzer used to create the index will be used on the terms and phrases in the query string. So it is important to choose an analyzer that will not interfere with the terms used in the query string. Fields Lucene supports fielded data. When performing a search you can either specify a field, or use the default field. The field names and default field is implementation specific. You can search any field by typing the field name followed by a colon \":\" and then the term you are looking for. As an example, let's assume a Lucene index contains two fields, title and text and text is the default field. If you want to find the document entitled \"The Right Way\" which contains the text \"don't go this way\", you can enter: title:\"The Right Way\" AND text:go or title:\"The Right Way\" AND go Since text is the default field, the field indicator is not required. Note: The field is only valid for the term that it directly precedes, so the query title:The Right Way Will only find \"The\" in the title field. It will find \"Right\" and \"Way\" in the default field (in this case the text field). Term Modifiers Lucene supports modifying query terms to provide a wide range of searching options. Wildcard Searches Lucene supports single and multiple character wildcard searches within single terms (not within phrase queries). To perform a single character wildcard search use the \"?\" symbol. To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the \"*\" symbol. The single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced. For example, to search for \"text\" or \"test\" you can use the search: te?t Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For example, to search for test, tests or tester, you can use the search: test* You can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term. te*t Note: You cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search. Regular Expression Searches Lucene supports regular expression searches matching a pattern between forward slashes \"/\". The syntax may change across releases, but the current supported syntax is documented in the RegExp class. For example to find documents containing \"moat\" or \"boat\": /[mb]oat/ Fuzzy Searches Lucene supports fuzzy searches based on Damerau-Levenshtein Distance. To do a fuzzy search use the tilde, \"~\", symbol at the end of a Single word Term. For example to search for a term similar in spelling to \"roam\" use the fuzzy search: roam~ This search will find terms like foam and roams. An additional (optional) parameter can specify the maximum number of edits allowed. The value is between 0 and 2, For example: roam~1 The default that is used if the parameter is not given is 2 edit distances. Previously, a floating point value was allowed here. This syntax is considered deprecated and will be removed in Lucene 5.0 Proximity Searches Lucene supports finding words are a within a specific distance away. To do a proximity search use the tilde, \"~\", symbol at the end of a Phrase. For example to search for a \"apache\" and \"jakarta\" within 10 words of each other in a document use the search: \"jakarta apache\"~10 Range Searches Range Queries allow one to match documents whose field(s) values are between the lower and upper bound specified by the Range Query. Range Queries can be inclusive or exclusive of the upper and lower bounds. Sorting is done lexicographically. mod_date:[20020101 TO 20030101] This will find documents whose mod_date fields have values between 20020101 and 20030101, inclusive. Note that Range Queries are not reserved for date fields. You could also use range queries with non-date fields: title:{Aida TO Carmen} This will find all documents whose titles are between Aida and Carmen, but not including Aida and Carmen. Inclusive range queries are denoted by square brackets. Exclusive range queries are denoted by curly brackets. Boosting a Term Lucene provides the relevance level of matching documents based on the terms found. To boost a term use the caret, \"^\", symbol with a boost factor (a number) at the end of the term you are searching. The higher the boost factor, the more relevant the term will be. Boosting allows you to control the relevance of a document by boosting its term. For example, if you are searching for jakarta apache and you want the term \"jakarta\" to be more relevant boost it using the ^ symbol along with the boost factor next to the term. You would type: jakarta^4 apache This will make documents with the term jakarta appear more relevant. You can also boost Phrase Terms as in the example: \"jakarta apache\"^4 \"Apache Lucene\" By default, the boost factor is 1. Although the boost factor must be positive, it can be less than 1 (e.g. 0.2) Boolean Operators Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators. Lucene supports AND, \"+\", OR, NOT and \"-\" as Boolean operators(Note: Boolean operators must be ALL CAPS). OR The OR operator is the default conjunction operator. This means that if there is no Boolean operator between two terms, the OR operator is used. The OR operator links two terms and finds a matching document if either of the terms exist in a document. This is equivalent to a union using sets. The symbol || can be used in place of the word OR. To search for documents that contain either \"jakarta apache\" or just \"jakarta\" use the query: \"jakarta apache\" jakarta or \"jakarta apache\" OR jakarta AND The AND operator matches documents where both terms exist anywhere in the text of a single document. This is equivalent to an intersection using sets. The symbol && can be used in place of the word AND. To search for documents that contain \"jakarta apache\" and \"Apache Lucene\" use the query: \"jakarta apache\" AND \"Apache Lucene\" + The \"+\" or required operator requires that the term after the \"+\" symbol exist somewhere in a the field of a single document. To search for documents that must contain \"jakarta\" and may contain \"lucene\" use the query: +jakarta lucene NOT The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term after NOT. This is equivalent to a difference using sets. The symbol ! can be used in place of the word NOT. To search for documents that contain \"jakarta apache\" but not \"Apache Lucene\" use the query: \"jakarta apache\" NOT \"Apache Lucene\" Note: The NOT operator cannot be used with just one term. For example, the following search will return no results: NOT \"jakarta apache\" - The \"-\" or prohibit operator excludes documents that contain the term after the \"-\" symbol. To search for documents that contain \"jakarta apache\" but not \"Apache Lucene\" use the query: \"jakarta apache\" -\"Apache Lucene\" Grouping Lucene supports using parentheses to group clauses to form sub queries. This can be very useful if you want to control the boolean logic for a query. To search for either \"jakarta\" or \"apache\" and \"website\" use the query: (jakarta OR apache) AND website This eliminates any confusion and makes sure you that website must exist and either term jakarta or apache may exist. Field Grouping Lucene supports using parentheses to group multiple clauses to a single field. To search for a title that contains both the word \"return\" and the phrase \"pink panther\" use the query: title:(+return +\"pink panther\") Escaping Special Characters Lucene supports escaping special characters that are part of the query syntax. The current list special characters are + - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ \" ~ * ? : \\ / To escape these character use the \\ before the character. For example to search for (1+1):2 use the query: \\(1\\+1\\)\\:2 Classes FastCharStream An efficient implementation of JavaCC's ICharStream interface. Note that this does not do line-number counting, but instead keeps track of the character position of the token in the input, as required by Lucene's Token API. LexicalToken MultiFieldQueryParser A QueryParser which constructs queries to search multiple fields. ParseException This exception is thrown when parse errors are encountered. You can explicitly create objects of this exception type by calling the method GenerateParseException in the generated parser. You can modify this class to customize your error reporting mechanisms so long as you retain the public fields. QueryParser This class is generated by JavaCC. The most important method is Parse(String) . The syntax for query strings is as follows: A Query is a series of clauses. A clause may be prefixed by: a plus ( + ) or a minus ( - ) sign, indicating that the clause is required or prohibited respectively; or a term followed by a colon, indicating the field to be searched. This enables one to construct queries which search multiple fields. A clause may be either: a term, indicating all the documents that contain this term; or a nested query, enclosed in parentheses. Note that this may be used with a + / - prefix to require any of a set of terms. Thus, in BNF, the query grammar is: Query ::= ( Clause )* Clause ::= [\"+\", \"-\"] [<TERM> \":\"] ( <TERM> | \"(\" Query \")\" ) Examples of appropriately formatted queries can be found in the query syntax documentation . In TermRangeQuery s, QueryParser tries to detect date values, e.g. date:[6/1/2005 TO 6/4/2005] produces a range query that searches for \"date\" fields between 2005-06-01 and 2005-06-04. Note that the format of the accepted input depends on the System.Globalization.CultureInfo . A Lucene.Net.Documents.DateTools.Resolution has to be set, if you want to use DateTools for date conversion. The date resolution that shall be used for RangeQueries can be set using SetDateResolution(DateTools.Resolution) or SetDateResolution(String, DateTools.Resolution) . The former sets the default date resolution for all fields, whereas the latter can be used to set field specific date resolutions. Field specific date resolutions take, if set, precedence over the default date resolution. If you don't use DateTools in your index, you can create your own query parser that inherits QueryParser and overwrites GetRangeQuery(String, String, String, Boolean, Boolean) to use a different method for date conversion. Note that QueryParser is not thread-safe. NOTE : there is a new QueryParser in contrib, which matches the same syntax as this class, but is more modular, enabling substantial customization to how a query is created. NOTE : You must specify the required Lucene.Net.Util.LuceneVersion compatibility when creating QueryParser: As of 3.1, AutoGeneratePhraseQueries is false by default. QueryParserBase This class is overridden by QueryParser . QueryParserBase.MethodRemovedUseAnother Do not catch this exception in your code, it means you are using methods that you should no longer use. QueryParserConstants Token literal values and constants. Generated by org.javacc.parser.OtherFilesGen#start() QueryParserTokenManager Token Manager. RegexpToken Token Describes the input token stream. TokenMgrError Token Manager Error. Interfaces ICharStream This interface describes a character stream that maintains line and column number positions of the characters. It also has the capability to backup the stream to some extent. An implementation of this interface is used in the TokenManager implementation generated by JavaCCParser. All the methods except BackUp(Int32) can be implemented in any fashion. BackUp(Int32) needs to be implemented correctly for the correct operation of the lexer. Rest of the methods are all used to get information like line number, column number and the string that constitutes a token and are not used by the lexer. Hence their implementation won't affect the generated lexer's operation. Enums Operator The default operator for parsing queries. Use DefaultOperator to change it."

    "title": "Class QueryParser | Apache Lucene.NET 4.8.0-beta00014 Documentation",
    "keywords": "Class QueryParser This class is generated by JavaCC. The most important method is Parse(String) . The syntax for query strings is as follows: A Query is a series of clauses. A clause may be prefixed by: a plus ( + ) or a minus ( - ) sign, indicating that the clause is required or prohibited respectively; or a term followed by a colon, indicating the field to be searched. This enables one to construct queries which search multiple fields. A clause may be either: a term, indicating all the documents that contain this term; or a nested query, enclosed in parentheses. Note that this may be used with a + / - prefix to require any of a set of terms. Thus, in BNF, the query grammar is: Query ::= ( Clause )* Clause ::= [\"+\", \"-\"] [<TERM> \":\"] ( <TERM> | \"(\" Query \")\" ) Examples of appropriately formatted queries can be found in the query syntax documentation . In TermRangeQuery s, QueryParser tries to detect date values, e.g. date:[6/1/2005 TO 6/4/2005] produces a range query that searches for \"date\" fields between 2005-06-01 and 2005-06-04. Note that the format of the accepted input depends on the System.Globalization.CultureInfo . A Lucene.Net.Documents.DateTools.Resolution has to be set, if you want to use DateTools for date conversion. The date resolution that shall be used for RangeQueries can be set using SetDateResolution(DateTools.Resolution) or SetDateResolution(String, DateTools.Resolution) . The former sets the default date resolution for all fields, whereas the latter can be used to set field specific date resolutions. Field specific date resolutions take, if set, precedence over the default date resolution. If you don't use DateTools in your index, you can create your own query parser that inherits QueryParser and overwrites GetRangeQuery(String, String, String, Boolean, Boolean) to use a different method for date conversion. Note that QueryParser is not thread-safe. NOTE : there is a new QueryParser in contrib, which matches the same syntax as this class, but is more modular, enabling substantial customization to how a query is created. NOTE : You must specify the required Lucene.Net.Util.LuceneVersion compatibility when creating QueryParser: As of 3.1, AutoGeneratePhraseQueries is false by default.

Query Parser Builders The namespace Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Core.Builders contains the interface that builders must implement, it also contain a utility QueryTreeBuilder , which walks the tree and call the Builder for each node in the tree. Builder normally convert QueryNode Object into a Lucene Query Object, and normally it's a one-to-one mapping class. But other builders implementations can by written to convert QueryNode objects to other non-Lucene objects. Classes QueryTreeBuilder LUCENENET specific class for accessing static members of QueryTreeBuilder<TQuery> without referencing its generic closing type. QueryTreeBuilder<TQuery> This class should be used when there is a builder for each type of node. The type of node may be defined in 2 different ways: - by the field name, when the node implements the IFieldableNode interface - by its class, it keeps checking the class and all the interfaces and classes this class implements/extends until it finds a builder for that class/interface This class always check if there is a builder for the field name before it checks for the node class. So, field name builders have precedence over class builders. When a builder is found for a node, it's called and the node is passed to the builder. If the returned built object is not null , it's tagged on the node using the tag QUERY_TREE_BUILDER_TAGID . The children are usually built before the parent node. However, if a builder associated to a node is an instance of QueryTreeBuilder<TQuery> , the node is delegated to this builder and it's responsible to build the node and its children. IQueryBuilder<TQuery> Interfaces IQueryBuilder<TQuery> This interface is used by implementors classes that builds some kind of object from a query tree. QueryTreeBuilder"

The type of node may be defined in 2 different ways: - by the field name, when the node implements the IFieldableNode interface - by its class, it keeps checking the class and all the interfaces and classes this class implements/extends until it finds a builder for that class/interface This class always check if there is a builder for the field name before it checks for the node class. So, field name builders have precedence over class builders. When a builder is found for a node, it's called and the node is passed to the builder. If the returned built object is not null , it's tagged on the node using the tag QUERY_TREE_BUILDER_TAGID . The children are usually built before the parent node. However, if a builder associated to a node is an instance of QueryTreeBuilder<TQuery> , the node is delegated to this builder and it's responsible to build the node and its children.

Flexible Query Parser This namespace contains the necessary classes to implement a query parser. A query parser is divided in at least 2 phases, text parsing and query building, and one optional phase called query processing. First Phase: Text Parsing The text parsing phase is performed by a text parser, which implements ISyntaxParser interface. A text parser is responsible to get a query string and convert it to a IQueryNode tree, which is an object structure that represents the elements defined in the query string. Second (optional) Phase: Query Processing The query processing phase is performed by a query processor, which implements QueryNodeProcessor . A query processor is responsible to perform any processing on a IQueryNode tree. This phase is optional and is used only if an extra processing, validation, query expansion, etc needs to be performed in a IQueryNode tree. The IQueryNode tree can be either be generated by a text parser or programmatically created. Third Phase: Query Building The query building phase is performed by a query builder, which implements <xref:Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Flexible.Core.Builders.IQueryBuilder{Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Flexible.Core.Nodes.IQueryNode}>. A query builder is responsible to convert a IQueryNode tree into an arbitrary object, which is usually used to be executed against a search index. Classes QueryNodeError Error class with NLS support QueryNodeException This exception should be thrown if something wrong happens when dealing with IQueryNode s. It also supports NLS messages. QueryNodeParseException This should be thrown when an exception happens during the query parsing from string to the query node tree. QueryParserHelper<TQuery> This class is a helper for the query parser framework, it does all the three query parser phrases at once: text parsing, query processing and query building. It contains methods that allows the user to change the implementation used on the three phases."

Query Nodes The namespace Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Flexible.Core.Nodes contains all the basic query nodes. The interface that represents a query node is IQueryNode . IQueryNode s are used by the text parser to create a syntax tree. These nodes are designed to be used by UI or other text parsers. The default Lucene text parser is StandardSyntaxParser , it implements Lucene's standard syntax. IQueryNode interface should be implemented by all query nodes, the class QueryNode implements IQueryNode and is extended by all current query node implementations. A query node tree can be printed to the a stream, and it generates a pseudo XML representation with all the nodes. A query node tree can also generate a query string that can be parsed back by the original text parser, at this point only the standard lucene syntax is supported. Grouping nodes: AndQueryNode - used for AND operator AnyQueryNode - used for ANY operator OrQueryNode - used for OR operator BooleanQueryNode - used when no operator is specified ModifierQueryNode - used for modifier operator GroupQueryNode - used for parenthesis BoostQueryNode - used for boost operator SlopQueryNode - phrase slop FuzzyQueryNode - fuzzy node TermRangeQueryNode - used for parametric field: [low_value TO high_value] ProximityQueryNode - used for proximity search NumericRangeQueryNode - used for numeric range search TokenizedPhraseQueryNode - used by tokenizers/lemmatizers/analyzers for phrases/autophrases Leaf Nodes: FieldQueryNode - field/value node NumericQueryNode - used for numeric search PathQueryNode - IQueryNode object used with path-like queries OpaqueQueryNode - Used as for part of the query that can be parsed by other parsers. schema/value PrefixWildcardQueryNode - non-phrase wildcard query QuotedFieldQUeryNode - regular phrase node WildcardQueryNode - non-phrase wildcard query Utility Nodes: DeletedQueryNode - used by processors on optimizations MatchAllDocsQueryNode - used by processors on optimizations MatchNoDocsQueryNode - used by processors on optimizations NoTokenFoundQueryNode - used by tokenizers/lemmatizers/analyzers Classes AndQueryNode A AndQueryNode represents an AND boolean operation performed on a list of nodes. AnyQueryNode A AnyQueryNode represents an ANY operator performed on a list of nodes. BooleanQueryNode A BooleanQueryNode represents a list of elements which do not have an explicit boolean operator defined between them. It can be used to express a boolean query that intends to use the default boolean operator. BoostQueryNode A BoostQueryNode boosts the QueryNode tree which is under this node. So, it must only and always have one child. The boost value may vary from 0.0 to 1.0. DeletedQueryNode A DeletedQueryNode represents a node that was deleted from the query node tree. It can be removed from the tree using the RemoveDeletedQueryNodesProcessor processor. FieldQueryNode A FieldQueryNode represents a element that contains field/text tuple FuzzyQueryNode A FuzzyQueryNode represents a element that contains field/text/similarity tuple GroupQueryNode A GroupQueryNode represents a location where the original user typed real parenthesis on the query string. This class is useful for queries like: a) a AND b OR c b) ( a AND b) OR c Parenthesis might be used to define the boolean operation precedence. MatchAllDocsQueryNode A MatchAllDocsQueryNode indicates that a query node tree or subtree will match all documents if executed in the index. MatchNoDocsQueryNode A MatchNoDocsQueryNode indicates that a query node tree or subtree will not match any documents if executed in the index. ModifierExtensions ModifierQueryNode A ModifierQueryNode indicates the modifier value (+,-,?,NONE) for each term on the query string. For example \"+t1 -t2 t3\" will have a tree of: <BooleanQueryNode> <ModifierQueryNode modifier=\"MOD_REQ\"> <t1/> </ModifierQueryNode> <ModifierQueryNode modifier=\"MOD_NOT\"> <t2/> </ModifierQueryNode> <t3/> </BooleanQueryNode> NoTokenFoundQueryNode A NoTokenFoundQueryNode is used if a term is convert into no tokens by the tokenizer/lemmatizer/analyzer (null). OpaqueQueryNode A OpaqueQueryNode is used for specify values that are not supposed to be parsed by the parser. For example: and XPATH query in the middle of a query string a b @xpath:&apos;/bookstore/book[1]/title&apos; c d OrQueryNode A OrQueryNode represents an OR boolean operation performed on a list of nodes. PathQueryNode A PathQueryNode is used to store queries like /company/USA/California /product/shoes/brown. QueryText are objects that contain the text, begin position and end position in the query. Example how the text parser creates these objects: IList<PathQueryNode.QueryText> values = new List<PathQueryNode.QueryText>(); values.Add(new PathQueryNode.QueryText(\"company\", 1, 7)); values.Add(new PathQueryNode.QueryText(\"USA\", 9, 12)); values.Add(new PathQueryNode.QueryText(\"California\", 14, 23)); QueryNode q = new PathQueryNode(values); PathQueryNode.QueryText Term text with a beginning and end position PhraseSlopQueryNode Query node for PhraseQuery 's slop factor. ProximityQueryNode A ProximityQueryNode represents a query where the terms should meet specific distance conditions. (a b c) WITHIN [SENTENCE|PARAGRAPH|NUMBER] [INORDER] (\"a\" \"b\" \"c\") WITHIN [SENTENCE|PARAGRAPH|NUMBER] [INORDER] TODO: Add this to the future standard Lucene parser/processor/builder ProximityQueryNode_TypeExtensions ProximityType utility class containing the distance condition and number QueryNode A QueryNode is the default implementation of the interface IQueryNode QuotedFieldQueryNode A QuotedFieldQueryNode represents phrase query. Example: \"life is great\" SlopQueryNode A SlopQueryNode represents phrase query with a slop. From Lucene FAQ: Is there a way to use a proximity operator (like near or within) with Lucene? There is a variable called slop that allows you to perform NEAR/WITHIN-like queries. By default, slop is set to 0 so that only exact phrases will match. When using TextParser you can use this syntax to specify the slop: \"doug cutting\"~2 will find documents that contain \"doug cutting\" as well as ones that contain \"cutting doug\". TokenizedPhraseQueryNode A TokenizedPhraseQueryNode represents a node created by a code that tokenizes/lemmatizes/analyzes. Interfaces IFieldableNode A query node implements IFieldableNode interface to indicate that its children and itself are associated to a specific field. If it has any children which also implements this interface, it must ensure the children are associated to the same field. IFieldValuePairQueryNode<T> This interface should be implemented by IQueryNode that holds a field and an arbitrary value. IQueryNode A IQueryNode is a interface implemented by all nodes on a IQueryNode tree. IRangeQueryNode LUCENENET specific interface for identifying a RangeQueryNode without specifying its generic closing type IRangeQueryNode<T> This interface should be implemented by an IQueryNode that represents some kind of range query. ITextableQueryNode Interface for a node that has text as a J2N.Text.ICharSequence IValueQueryNode<T> This interface should be implemented by IQueryNode that holds an arbitrary value. Enums Modifier Modifier type: such as required (REQ), prohibited (NOT) ProximityQueryNode.Type Distance condition: PARAGRAPH, SENTENCE, or NUMBER"

The interface that every query node processor should implement is IQueryNodeProcessor . A query node processor should be used to process a IQueryNode tree. IQueryNode trees can be programmatically created or generated by a text parser. See Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Flexible.Core.Parser for more details about text parsers. A query node processor should be used to process a IQueryNode tree. IQueryNode trees can be programmatically created or generated by a text parser. See Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Flexible.Core.Parser for more details about text parsers. A pipeline of processors can be assembled using QueryNodeProcessorPipeline . Implementors may want to extend QueryNodeProcessor , which simplifies the implementation, because it walks automatically the IQueryNode . See QueryNodeProcessor for more details. Classes NoChildOptimizationQueryNodeProcessor A NoChildOptimizationQueryNodeProcessor removes every BooleanQueryNode, BoostQueryNode, TokenizedPhraseQueryNode or ModifierQueryNode that do not have a valid children. Example: When the children of these nodes are removed for any reason then the nodes may become invalid. QueryNodeProcessor This is a default implementation for the IQueryNodeProcessor interface, it's an abstract class, so it should be extended by classes that want to process a IQueryNode tree. This class process IQueryNode s from left to right in the tree. While it's walking down the tree, for every node, PreProcessNode(IQueryNode) is invoked. After a node's children are processed, PostProcessNode(IQueryNode) is invoked for that node. SetChildrenOrder(IList<IQueryNode>) is invoked before PostProcessNode(IQueryNode) only if the node has at least one child, in SetChildrenOrder(IList<IQueryNode>) the implementor might redefine the children order or remove any children from the children list. Here is an example about how it process the nodes: a / \\ b e / \\ c d Here is the order the methods would be invoked for the tree described above: PreProcessNode( a ); PreProcessNode( b ); PreProcessNode( c ); PostProcessNode( c ); PreProcessNode( d ); PostProcessNode( d ); SetChildrenOrder( bChildrenList ); PostProcessNode( b ); PreProcessNode( e ); PostProcessNode( e ); SetChildrenOrder( aChildrenList ); PostProcessNode( a ) QueryNodeProcessorPipeline A QueryNodeProcessorPipeline class should be used to build a query node processor pipeline. When a query node tree is processed using this class, it passes the query node tree to each processor on the pipeline and the result from each processor is passed to the next one, always following the order the processors were on the pipeline. When a QueryConfigHandler object is set on a QueryNodeProcessorPipeline , it also takes care of setting this QueryConfigHandler on all processor on pipeline. RemoveDeletedQueryNodesProcessor A QueryNodeProcessorPipeline class removes every instance of DeletedQueryNode from a query node tree. If the resulting root node is a DeletedQueryNode , MatchNoDocsQueryNode is returned. Interfaces IQueryNodeProcessor An IQueryNodeProcessor is an interface for classes that process a IQueryNode tree. The implementor of this class should perform some operation on a query node tree and return the same or another query node tree. It also may carry a QueryConfigHandler object that contains configuration about the query represented by the query tree or the collection/index where it's intended to be executed. In case there is any QueryConfigHandler associated to the query tree to be processed, it should be set using SetQueryConfigHandler(QueryConfigHandler) before Process(IQueryNode) is invoked."

NLS message API This utility API, adds support for NLS messages in the apache code. It is currently used by the lucene \"New Flexible Query PArser\". Features: Message reference in the code, using static Strings Message resource validation at class load time, for easier debugging Allows for message IDs to be re-factored using code re-factor tools Allows for reference count on messages, just like code Lazy loading of Message Strings Normal loading Message Strings Prerequisite for these examples: Add a resource file named MessagesTestBundle.resx and add messages for each of the public static string fields except for Q0005E_Message_Not_In_Bundle . Lazy loading of Message Strings public class MessagesTest : NLS { private static readonly string BundleName = typeof(MessagesTest).FullName; private MessagesTest() { // should never be instantiated } static MessagesTest() { InitializeMessages(BundleName, typeof(MessagesTest)); } // static string must match the strings in the property files. public static string Q0001E_Invalid_Syntax; public static string Q0004E_Invalid_Syntax_Escape_Unicode_Truncation; // this message is missing from the properties file public static string Q0005E_Message_Not_In_Bundle; } // Create a message reference IMessage invalidSyntax = new Message(MessagesTest.Q0001E_Invalid_Syntax, \"XXX\"); // Do other stuff in the code... // when is time to display the message to the user or log the message on a file // the message is loaded from the correct bundle string message1 = invalidSyntax.GetLocalizedMessage(); string message2 = invalidSyntax.GetLocalizedMessage(new CultureInfo(\"ja\")); Normal loading of Message Strings string message1 = NLS.GetLocalizedMessage(MessagesTest.Q0004E_Invalid_Syntax_Escape_Unicode_Truncation); string message2 = NLS.GetLocalizedMessage(MessagesTest.Q0004E_Invalid_Syntax_Escape_Unicode_Truncation, new CultureInfo(\"ja\")); The Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Flexible.Messages.TestNLS NUnit test contains several other examples. The TestNLS C# code is available from the Apache Lucene.NET code repository. Classes Message Default implementation of Message interface. For Native Language Support (NLS), system of software internationalization. NLS MessageBundles classes extend this class, to implement a bundle. For Native Language Support (NLS), system of software internationalization. This interface is similar to the NLS class in eclipse.osgi.util.NLS class - initializeMessages() method resets the values of all static strings, should only be called by classes that extend from NLS (see TestMessages.java for reference) - performs validation of all message in a bundle, at class load time - performs per message validation at runtime - see NLSTest.java for usage reference MessageBundle classes may subclass this type.

Standard Lucene Query Node Builders The namespace Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Flexible.Standard.Builders contains all the builders needed to build a Lucene Query object from a query node tree. These builders expect the query node tree was already processed by the StandardQueryNodeProcessorPipeline . StandardQueryTreeBuilder is a builder that already contains a defined map that maps each QueryNode object with its respective builder. Classes AnyQueryNodeBuilder Builds a Lucene.Net.Search.BooleanQuery of SHOULD clauses, possibly with some minimum number to match. BooleanQueryNodeBuilder Builds a Lucene.Net.Search.BooleanQuery object from a BooleanQueryNode object. Every children in the BooleanQueryNode object must be already tagged using QUERY_TREE_BUILDER_TAGID with a Lucene.Net.Search.Query object. It takes in consideration if the children is a ModifierQueryNode to define the Lucene.Net.Search.BooleanClause . BoostQueryNodeBuilder This builder basically reads the Lucene.Net.Search.Query object set on the BoostQueryNode child using QUERY_TREE_BUILDER_TAGID and applies the boost value defined in the BoostQueryNode . DummyQueryNodeBuilder This builder does nothing. Commonly used for IQueryNode objects that are built by its parent's builder. FieldQueryNodeBuilder Builds a Lucene.Net.Search.TermQuery object from a FieldQueryNode object. FuzzyQueryNodeBuilder Builds a FuzzyQuery object from a FuzzyQueryNode object. GroupQueryNodeBuilder Builds no object, it only returns the Lucene.Net.Search.Query object set on the GroupQueryNode object using a QUERY_TREE_BUILDER_TAGID tag. MatchAllDocsQueryNodeBuilder Builds a MatchAllDocsQuery object from a MatchAllDocsQueryNode object. MatchNoDocsQueryNodeBuilder Builds an empty Lucene.Net.Search.BooleanQuery object from a MatchNoDocsQueryNode object. ModifierQueryNodeBuilder Builds no object, it only returns the Lucene.Net.Search.Query object set on the ModifierQueryNode object using a QUERY_TREE_BUILDER_TAGID tag. MultiPhraseQueryNodeBuilder Builds a MultiPhraseQuery object from a MultiPhraseQueryNode object. NumericRangeQueryNodeBuilder Builds NumericRangeQuery s out of NumericRangeQueryNode s. PhraseQueryNodeBuilder Builds a PhraseQuery object from a TokenizedPhraseQueryNode object. PrefixWildcardQueryNodeBuilder Builds a PrefixQuery object from a PrefixWildcardQueryNode object. RegexpQueryNodeBuilder Builds a RegexpQuery object from a RegexpQueryNode object. SlopQueryNodeBuilder This builder basically reads the Lucene.Net.Search.Query object set on the SlopQueryNode child using QUERY_TREE_BUILDER_TAGID and applies the slop value defined in the SlopQueryNode . StandardBooleanQueryNodeBuilder This builder does the same as the BooleanQueryNodeBuilder , but this considers if the built Lucene.Net.Search.BooleanQuery should have its coord disabled or not. StandardQueryTreeBuilder This query tree builder only defines the necessary map to build a Lucene.Net.Search.Query tree object. It should be used to generate a Lucene.Net.Search.Query tree object from a query node tree processed by a StandardQueryNodeProcessorPipeline . TermRangeQueryNodeBuilder Builds a TermRangeQuery object from a TermRangeQueryNode object. WildcardQueryNodeBuilder Builds a WildcardQuery object from a WildcardQueryNode object. Interfaces IStandardQueryBuilder This interface should be implemented by every class that wants to build Lucene.Net.Search.Query objects from IQueryNode objects."

In the new query parser structure, the parsing was divided in 3 steps: parsing (syntax), processing (semantic) and building. The classes contained in the namespace Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Flexible.Standard are used to reproduce the same behavior as the old query parser. Check StandardQueryParser to quick start using the Lucene query parser. Classes QueryParserUtil This class defines utility methods to (help) parse query strings into Lucene.Net.Search.Query objects. StandardQueryParser This class is a helper that enables users to easily use the Lucene query parser. To construct a Query object from a query string, use the Parse(String, String) method: StandardQueryParser queryParserHelper = new StandardQueryParser(); Query query = queryParserHelper.Parse(\"a AND b\", \"defaultField\"); To change any configuration before parsing the query string do, for example: // the query config handler returned by StandardQueryParser is a // StandardQueryConfigHandler queryParserHelper.QueryConfigHandler.Analyzer = new WhitespaceAnalyzer(); The syntax for query strings is as follows (copied from the old QueryParser javadoc): A Query is a series of clauses. A clause may be prefixed by: a plus ( + ) or a minus ( - ) sign, indicating that the clause is required or prohibited respectively; or a term followed by a colon, indicating the field to be searched. This enables one to construct queries which search multiple fields. A clause may be either: a term, indicating all the documents that contain this term; or a nested query, enclosed in parentheses. Note that this may be used with a + / - prefix to require any of a set of terms. Thus, in BNF, the query grammar is: Query ::= ( Clause )* Clause ::= [\"+\", \"-\"] [<TERM> \":\"] ( <TERM> | \"(\" Query \")\" ) Examples of appropriately formatted queries can be found in the query syntax documentation. The text parser used by this helper is a StandardSyntaxParser . The query node processor used by this helper is a StandardQueryNodeProcessorPipeline . The builder used by this helper is a StandardQueryTreeBuilder . Interfaces ICommonQueryParserConfiguration Configuration options common across queryparser implementations."

Lexer calls this method if it had already read some characters, but could not use them to match a (longer) token. So, they will be used again as the prefix of the next token and it is the implemetation's responsibility to do this right. Declaration void BackUp(int amount) Parameters Type Name Description System.Int32 amount | Improve this Doc View Source BeginToken() Returns the next character that marks the beginning of the next token. All characters must remain in the buffer between two successive calls to this method to implement BackUp(Int32) correctly.

Again, the body of this function can be just empty and it will not affect the lexer's operation. Declaration void Done() | Improve this Doc View Source GetImage() Returns a string made up of characters from the marked token beginning to the current buffer position. Implementations have the choice of returning anything that they want to. For example, for efficiency, one might decide to just return null, which is a valid implementation. Declaration string GetImage() Returns Type Description System.String | Improve this Doc View Source GetSuffix(Int32) Returns an array of characters that make up the suffix of length 'len' for the currently matched token. This is used to build up the matched string for use in actions in the case of MORE.

Lucene Query Node Processors The namespace Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Flexible.Standard.Processors contains every processor needed to assembly a pipeline that modifies the query node tree according to the actual Lucene queries. These processors are already assembled correctly in the StandardQueryNodeProcessorPipeline. Classes AllowLeadingWildcardProcessor This processor verifies if ALLOW_LEADING_WILDCARD is defined in the QueryConfigHandler . If it is and leading wildcard is not allowed, it looks for every WildcardQueryNode contained in the query node tree and throws an exception if any of them has a leading wildcard ('*' or '?'). AnalyzerQueryNodeProcessor This processor verifies if ANALYZER is defined in the QueryConfigHandler . If it is and the analyzer is not null , it looks for every FieldQueryNode that is not WildcardQueryNode , FuzzyQueryNode or IRangeQueryNode contained in the query node tree, then it applies the analyzer to that FieldQueryNode object. If the analyzer return only one term, the returned term is set to the FieldQueryNode and it's returned. If the analyzer return more than one term, a TokenizedPhraseQueryNode or MultiPhraseQueryNode is created, whether there is one or more terms at the same position, and it's returned. If no term is returned by the analyzer a NoTokenFoundQueryNode object is returned. BooleanQuery2ModifierNodeProcessor This processor is used to apply the correct ModifierQueryNode to BooleanQueryNode s children. This is a variant of BooleanModifiersQueryNodeProcessor which ignores precedence. The StandardSyntaxParser knows the rules of precedence, but lucene does not. e.g. (A AND B OR C AND D) ist treated like (+A +B +C +D) . This processor walks through the query node tree looking for BooleanQueryNode s. If an AndQueryNode is found, every child, which is not a ModifierQueryNode or the ModifierQueryNode is MOD_NONE , becomes a MOD_REQ . For default BooleanQueryNode , it checks the default operator is AND , if it is, the same operation when an AndQueryNode is found is applied to it. Each BooleanQueryNode which direct parent is also a BooleanQueryNode is removed (to ignore the rules of precedence). BooleanSingleChildOptimizationQueryNodeProcessor This processor removes every BooleanQueryNode that contains only one child and returns this child. If this child is ModifierQueryNode that was defined by the user. A modifier is not defined by the user when it's a BooleanModifierNode BoostQueryNodeProcessor This processor iterates the query node tree looking for every IFieldableNode that has BOOST in its config. If there is, the boost is applied to that IFieldableNode . DefaultPhraseSlopQueryNodeProcessor This processor verifies if PHRASE_SLOP is defined in the QueryConfigHandler . If it is, it looks for every TokenizedPhraseQueryNode and MultiPhraseQueryNode that does not have any SlopQueryNode applied to it and creates an SlopQueryNode and apply to it. The new SlopQueryNode has the same slop value defined in the configuration. FuzzyQueryNodeProcessor This processor iterates the query node tree looking for every FuzzyQueryNode , when this kind of node is found, it checks on the query configuration for FUZZY_CONFIG , gets the fuzzy prefix length and default similarity from it and set to the fuzzy node. For more information about fuzzy prefix length check: FuzzyQuery . GroupQueryNodeProcessor The ISyntaxParser generates query node trees that consider the boolean operator precedence, but Lucene current syntax does not support boolean precedence, so this processor remove all the precedence and apply the equivalent modifier according to the boolean operation defined on an specific query node. If there is a GroupQueryNode in the query node tree, the query node tree is not merged with the one above it. Example: TODO: describe a good example to show how this processor works LowercaseExpandedTermsQueryNodeProcessor This processor verifies if LOWERCASE_EXPANDED_TERMS is defined in the QueryConfigHandler . If it is and the expanded terms should be lower-cased, it looks for every WildcardQueryNode , FuzzyQueryNode and children of a IRangeQueryNode and lower-case its term. MatchAllDocsQueryNodeProcessor This processor converts every WildcardQueryNode that is \" : \" to MatchAllDocsQueryNode . MultiFieldQueryNodeProcessor This processor is used to expand terms so the query looks for the same term in different fields. It also boosts a query based on its field. This processor looks for every IFieldableNode contained in the query node tree. If a IFieldableNode is found, it checks if there is a MULTI_FIELDS defined in the QueryConfigHandler . If there is, the IFieldableNode is cloned N times and the clones are added to a BooleanQueryNode together with the original node. N is defined by the number of fields that it will be expanded to. The BooleanQueryNode is returned. MultiTermRewriteMethodProcessor This processor instates the default Lucene.Net.Search.MultiTermQuery.RewriteMethod , CONSTANT_SCORE_AUTO_REWRITE_DEFAULT , for multi-term query nodes. NumericQueryNodeProcessor This processor is used to convert FieldQueryNode s to NumericRangeQueryNode s. It looks for NUMERIC_CONFIG set in the FieldConfig of every FieldQueryNode found. If NUMERIC_CONFIG is found, it considers that FieldQueryNode to be a numeric query and convert it to NumericRangeQueryNode with upper and lower inclusive and lower and upper equals to the value represented by the FieldQueryNode converted to System.Object representing a .NET numeric type. It means that field:1 is converted to field:[1 TO 1] . Note that FieldQueryNode s children of a IRangeQueryNode are ignored. NumericRangeQueryNodeProcessor This processor is used to convert TermRangeQueryNode s to NumericRangeQueryNode s. It looks for NUMERIC_CONFIG set in the FieldConfig of every TermRangeQueryNode found. If NUMERIC_CONFIG is found, it considers that TermRangeQueryNode to be a numeric range query and convert it to NumericRangeQueryNode . OpenRangeQueryNodeProcessor Processes TermRangeQuery s with open ranges. PhraseSlopQueryNodeProcessor This processor removes invalid SlopQueryNode objects in the query node tree. A SlopQueryNode is invalid if its child is neither a TokenizedPhraseQueryNode nor a MultiPhraseQueryNode . RemoveEmptyNonLeafQueryNodeProcessor This processor removes every IQueryNode that is not a leaf and has not children. If after processing the entire tree the root node is not a leaf and has no children, a MatchNoDocsQueryNode object is returned. This processor is used at the end of a pipeline to avoid invalid query node tree structures like a GroupQueryNode or ModifierQueryNode with no children. StandardQueryNodeProcessorPipeline This pipeline has all the processors needed to process a query node tree, generated by StandardSyntaxParser , already assembled. The order they are assembled affects the results. This processor pipeline was designed to work with StandardQueryConfigHandler . The result query node tree can be used to build a Lucene.Net.Search.Query object using StandardQueryTreeBuilder . TermRangeQueryNodeProcessor This processors process TermRangeQueryNode s. It reads the lower and upper bounds value from the TermRangeQueryNode object and try to parse their values using a dateFormat . If the values cannot be parsed to a date value, it will only create the TermRangeQueryNode using the non-parsed values. If a LOCALE is defined in the QueryConfigHandler it will be used to parse the date, otherwise System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture will be used. If a DATE_RESOLUTION is defined and the Lucene.Net.Documents.DateTools.Resolution is not null it will also be used to parse the date value. WildcardQueryNodeProcessor The StandardSyntaxParser creates PrefixWildcardQueryNode nodes which have values containing the prefixed wildcard. However, Lucene PrefixQuery cannot contain the prefixed wildcard. So, this processor basically removed the prefixed wildcard from the PrefixWildcardQueryNode value."

To construct a Query object from a query string, use the Parse(String, String) method: StandardQueryParser queryParserHelper = new StandardQueryParser(); Query query = queryParserHelper.Parse(\"a AND b\", \"defaultField\"); To change any configuration before parsing the query string do, for example: // the query config handler returned by StandardQueryParser is a // StandardQueryConfigHandler queryParserHelper.QueryConfigHandler.Analyzer = new WhitespaceAnalyzer(); The syntax for query strings is as follows (copied from the old QueryParser javadoc): A Query is a series of clauses. A clause may be prefixed by: a plus ( + ) or a minus ( - ) sign, indicating that the clause is required or prohibited respectively; or a term followed by a colon, indicating the field to be searched. This enables one to construct queries which search multiple fields. A clause may be either: a term, indicating all the documents that contain this term; or a nested query, enclosed in parentheses. Note that this may be used with a + / - prefix to require any of a set of terms. Thus, in BNF, the query grammar is: Query ::= ( Clause )* Clause ::= [\"+\", \"-\"] [<TERM> \":\"] ( <TERM> | \"(\" Query \")\" ) Examples of appropriately formatted queries can be found in the query syntax documentation.

LexicalToken ParseException This exception is thrown when parse errors are encountered. You can explicitly create objects of this exception type by calling the method GenerateParseException in the generated parser. You can modify this class to customize your error reporting mechanisms so long as you retain the public fields. QueryParser This class is generated by JavaCC. The only method that clients should need to call is Parse(String) . This parser generates queries that make use of position information (Span queries). It provides positional operators ( w and n ) that accept a numeric distance, as well as boolean operators ( and , or , and not , wildcards ( /// and ? ), quoting (with \" ), and boosting (via ^ ). The operators (W, N, AND, OR, NOT) can be expressed lower-cased or upper-cased, and the non-unary operators (everything but NOT) support both infix (a AND b AND c) and prefix AND(a, b, c) notation. The W and N operators express a positional relationship among their operands. N is ordered, and W is unordered. The distance is 1 by default, meaning the operands are adjacent, or may be provided as a prefix from 2-99. So, for example, 3W(a, b) means that terms a and b must appear within three positions of each other, or in other words, up to two terms may appear between a and b.

Interfaces ICharStream This interface describes a character stream that maintains line and column number positions of the characters. It also has the capability to backup the stream to some extent. An implementation of this interface is used in the TokenManager implementation generated by JavaCCParser. All the methods except BackUp(Int32) can be implemented in any fashion. BackUp(Int32) needs to be implemented correctly for the correct operation of the lexer. Rest of the methods are all used to get information like line number, column number and the string that constitutes a token and are not used by the lexer.

    "keywords": "Class QueryParser This class is generated by JavaCC. The only method that clients should need to call is Parse(String) . This parser generates queries that make use of position information (Span queries). It provides positional operators ( w and n ) that accept a numeric distance, as well as boolean operators ( and , or , and not , wildcards ( /// and ? ), quoting (with \" ), and boosting (via ^ ). The operators (W, N, AND, OR, NOT) can be expressed lower-cased or upper-cased, and the non-unary operators (everything but NOT) support both infix (a AND b AND c) and prefix AND(a, b, c) notation. The W and N operators express a positional relationship among their operands. N is ordered, and W is unordered. The distance is 1 by default, meaning the operands are adjacent, or may be provided as a prefix from 2-99. So, for example, 3W(a, b) means that terms a and b must appear within three positions of each other, or in other words, up to two terms may appear between a and b.

DOMUtils Helper methods for parsing XML FilterBuilderFactory Factory for IFilterBuilder ParserException Thrown when the xml queryparser encounters invalid syntax/configuration. QueryBuilderFactory Factory for IQueryBuilder QueryTemplateManager Provides utilities for turning query form input (such as from a web page or Swing gui) into Lucene XML queries by using XSL templates. This approach offers a convenient way of externalizing and changing how user input is turned into Lucene queries. Database applications often adopt similar practices by externalizing SQL in template files that can be easily changed/optimized by a DBA. The static methods can be used on their own or by creating an instance of this class you can store and re-use compiled stylesheets for fast use (e.g. in a server environment) Interfaces IFilterBuilder Interface for building Lucene.Net.Search.Filter s IQueryBuilder Implemented by objects that produce Lucene Query objects from XML streams. Implementations are expected to be thread-safe so that they can be used to simultaneously parse multiple XML documents."

This module provides a number of queryparsers: Classic Analyzing Complex Phrase Extendable Flexible Surround XML Classic A Simple Lucene QueryParser implemented with JavaCC. Analyzing QueryParser that passes Fuzzy-, Prefix-, Range-, and WildcardQuerys through the given analyzer. Complex Phrase QueryParser which permits complex phrase query syntax eg \"(john jon jonathan~) peters*\" Extendable Extendable QueryParser provides a simple and flexible extension mechanism by overloading query field names. Flexible This project contains the new Lucene query parser implementation, which matches the syntax of the core QueryParser but offers a more modular architecture to enable customization. It's currently divided in 2 main namespaces: Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Flexible.Core : it contains the query parser API classes, which should be extended by query parser implementations. Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Flexible.Standard : it contains the current Lucene query parser implementation using the new query parser API. Features Full support for boolean logic (not enabled) QueryNode Trees - support for several syntaxes, that can be converted into similar syntax QueryNode trees. QueryNode Processors - Optimize, validate, rewrite the QueryNode trees Processors Pipelines - Select your favorite Processor and build a processor pipeline, to implement the features you need Config Interfaces - Allow the consumer of the Query Parser to implement a diff Config Handler Objects to suite their needs. Standard Builders - convert QueryNode's into several lucene representations. Supported conversion is using a 2.4 compatible logic QueryNode tree's can be converted to a lucene 2.4 syntax string, using ToQueryString() Design This new query parser was designed to have very generic architecture, so that it can be easily used for different products with varying query syntaxes. This code is much more flexible and extensible than the Lucene query parser in 2.4.X. The new query parser goal is to separate syntax and semantics of a query. E.g. 'a AND b', '+a +b', 'AND(a,b)' could be different syntaxes for the same query. It distinguishes the semantics of the different query components, e.g. whether and how to tokenize/lemmatize/normalize the different terms or which Query objects to create for the terms. It allows to write a parser with a new syntax, while reusing the underlying semantics, as quickly as possible. The query parser has three layers and its core is what we call the QueryNode tree. It is a tree that initially represents the syntax of the original query, e.g. for 'a AND b': AND / \\ A B The three layers are: QueryParser This layer is the text parsing layer which simply transforms the query text string into a IQueryNode tree. Every text parser must implement the interface ISyntaxParser . Lucene default implementations implements it using JavaCC. QueryNodeProcessor The query node processors do most of the work. It is in fact a configurable chain of processors. Each processors can walk the tree and modify nodes or even the tree's structure. That makes it possible to e.g. do query optimization before the query is executed or to tokenize terms. QueryBuilder The third layer is a configurable map of builders, which map IQueryNode types to its specific builder that will transform the IQueryNode into Lucene Query object. Furthermore, the query parser uses flexible configuration objects. It also uses message classes that allow to attach resource bundles. This makes it possible to translate messages, which is an important feature of a query parser. This design allows to develop different query syntaxes very quickly. StandardQueryParser and QueryParserWrapper The classic Lucene query parser is located under Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Classic . To make it simpler to use the new query parser the class StandardQueryParser may be helpful, specially for people that do not want to extend the Query Parser. It uses the default Lucene query processors, text parser and builders, so you don't need to worry about dealing with those. StandardQueryParser usage: const LuceneVersion matchVersion = LuceneVersion.LUCENE_48; StandardQueryParser qpHelper = new StandardQueryParser(); QueryConfigHandler config = qpHelper.QueryConfigHandler; config.Set(ConfigurationKeys.ALLOW_LEADING_WILDCARD, true); config.Set(ConfigurationKeys.ANALYZER, new WhitespaceAnalyzer(matchVersion)); Query query = qpHelper.Parse(\"apache AND lucene\", \"defaultField\"); Surround A QueryParser that supports the Span family of queries as well as pre and infix notation. It's divided in 2 main namespaces: Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Surround.Parser Lucene.Net.QueryParsers.Surround.Query XML A QueryParser that produces Lucene Query objects from XML documents."
