    "keywords": "Class AnalyzingSuggester Suggester that first analyzes the surface form, adds the analyzed form to a weighted FST, and then does the same thing at lookup time. This means lookup is based on the analyzed form while suggestions are still the surface form(s). This can result in powerful suggester functionality. For example, if you use an analyzer removing stop words, then the partial text \"ghost chr...\" could see the suggestion \"The Ghost of Christmas Past\". Note that position increments MUST NOT be preserved for this example to work, so you should call the constructor with Lucene.Net.Search.Suggest.Analyzing.AnalyzingSuggester.preservePositionIncrements parameter set to false If SynonymFilter is used to map wifi and wireless network to hotspot then the partial text \"wirele...\" could suggest \"wifi router\". Token normalization like stemmers, accent removal, etc., would allow suggestions to ignore such variations. When two matching suggestions have the same weight, they are tie-broken by the analyzed form. If their analyzed form is the same then the order is undefined. There are some limitations: A lookup from a query like \"net\" in English won't be any different than \"net \" (ie, user added a trailing space) because analyzers don't reflect when they've seen a token separator and when they haven't. If you're using Lucene.Net.Analysis.Core.StopFilter , and the user will type \"fast apple\", but so far all they've typed is \"fast a\", again because the analyzer doesn't convey whether it's seen a token separator after the \"a\", Lucene.Net.Analysis.Core.StopFilter will remove that \"a\" causing far more matches than you'd expect.

Classes AnalyzingInfixSuggester Analyzes the input text and then suggests matches based on prefix matches to any tokens in the indexed text. This also highlights the tokens that match. This suggester supports payloads. Matches are sorted only by the suggest weight; it would be nice to support blended score + weight sort in the future. This means this suggester best applies when there is a strong a-priori ranking of all the suggestions. This suggester supports contexts, however the contexts must be valid utf8 (arbitrary binary terms will not work). @lucene.experimental AnalyzingSuggester Suggester that first analyzes the surface form, adds the analyzed form to a weighted FST, and then does the same thing at lookup time. This means lookup is based on the analyzed form while suggestions are still the surface form(s). This can result in powerful suggester functionality. For example, if you use an analyzer removing stop words, then the partial text \"ghost chr...\" could see the suggestion \"The Ghost of Christmas Past\". Note that position increments MUST NOT be preserved for this example to work, so you should call the constructor with Lucene.Net.Search.Suggest.Analyzing.AnalyzingSuggester.preservePositionIncrements parameter set to false If SynonymFilter is used to map wifi and wireless network to hotspot then the partial text \"wirele...\" could suggest \"wifi router\". Token normalization like stemmers, accent removal, etc., would allow suggestions to ignore such variations. When two matching suggestions have the same weight, they are tie-broken by the analyzed form. If their analyzed form is the same then the order is undefined. There are some limitations: A lookup from a query like \"net\" in English won't be any different than \"net \" (ie, user added a trailing space) because analyzers don't reflect when they've seen a token separator and when they haven't. If you're using Lucene.Net.Analysis.Core.StopFilter , and the user will type \"fast apple\", but so far all they've typed is \"fast a\", again because the analyzer doesn't convey whether it's seen a token separator after the \"a\", Lucene.Net.Analysis.Core.StopFilter will remove that \"a\" causing far more matches than you'd expect. Lookups with the empty string return no results instead of all results. @lucene.experimental BlendedInfixSuggester Extension of the AnalyzingInfixSuggester which transforms the weight after search to take into account the position of the searched term into the indexed text. Please note that it increases the number of elements searched and applies the ponderation after. It might be costly for long suggestions. This is a Lucene.NET EXPERIMENTAL API, use at your own risk FreeTextSuggester Builds an ngram model from the text sent to Build(IInputEnumerator, Double) and predicts based on the last grams-1 tokens in the request sent to DoLookup(String, IEnumerable<BytesRef>, Boolean, Int32) . This tries to handle the \"long tail\" of suggestions for when the incoming query is a never before seen query string. Likely this suggester would only be used as a fallback, when the primary suggester fails to find any suggestions. Note that the weight for each suggestion is unused, and the suggestions are the analyzed forms (so your analysis process should normally be very \"light\"). This uses the stupid backoff language model to smooth scores across ngram models; see \"Large language models in machine translation\" for details. From DoLookup(String, IEnumerable<BytesRef>, Boolean, Int32) , the key of each result is the ngram token; the value is System.Int64.MaxValue * score (fixed point, cast to long). Divide by System.Int64.MaxValue to get the score back, which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. onlyMorePopular is unused. @lucene.experimental FSTUtil Exposes a utility method to enumerate all paths intersecting an Lucene.Net.Util.Automaton.Automaton with an FST . FSTUtil.Path<T> Holds a pair (automaton, fst) of states and accumulated output in the intersected machine. FuzzySuggester Implements a fuzzy AnalyzingSuggester .

This is a Lucene.NET EXPERIMENTAL API, use at your own risk SuggestStopFilter Like Lucene.Net.Analysis.Core.StopFilter except it will not remove the last token if that token was not followed by some token separator.

    "keywords": "Class FSTCompletionBuilder Finite state automata based implementation of \"autocomplete\" functionality. Implementation details The construction step in the object finalizer works as follows: A set of input terms and their buckets is given. All terms in the input are prefixed with a synthetic pseudo-character (code) of the weight bucket the term fell into. For example a term abc with a discretized weight equal '1' would become 1abc . The terms are then sorted by their raw value of UTF-8 character values (including the synthetic bucket code in front). A finite state automaton ( FST ) is constructed from the input. The root node has arcs labeled with all possible weights. We cache all these arcs, highest-weight first. At runtime, in DoLookup(String, Int32) , the automaton is utilized as follows: For each possible term weight encoded in the automaton (cached arcs from the root above), starting with the highest one, we descend along the path of the input key. If the key is not a prefix of a sequence in the automaton (path ends prematurely), we exit immediately -- no completions. Otherwise, we have found an internal automaton node that ends the key. The entire subautomaton (all paths) starting from this node form the key's completions. We start the traversal of this subautomaton. Every time we reach a final state (arc), we add a single suggestion to the list of results (the weight of this suggestion is constant and equal to the root path we started from). The tricky part is that because automaton edges are sorted and we scan depth-first, we can terminate the entire procedure as soon as we collect enough suggestions the user requested. In case the number of suggestions collected in the step above is still insufficient, we proceed to the next (smaller) weight leaving the root node and repeat the same algorithm again. Runtime behavior and performance characteristic The algorithm described above is optimized for finding suggestions to short prefixes in a top-weights-first order. This is probably the most common use case: it allows presenting suggestions early and sorts them by the global frequency (and then alphabetically). If there is an exact match in the automaton, it is returned first on the results list (even with by-weight sorting). Note that the maximum lookup time for any prefix is the time of descending to the subtree, plus traversal of the subtree up to the number of requested suggestions (because they are already presorted by weight on the root level and alphabetically at any node level). To order alphabetically only (no ordering by priorities), use identical term weights for all terms. Alphabetical suggestions are returned even if non-constant weights are used, but the algorithm for doing this is suboptimal. \"alphabetically\" in any of the documentation above indicates UTF-8 representation order, nothing else.

This is a Lucene.NET EXPERIMENTAL API, use at your own risk BufferingTermFreqEnumeratorWrapper This wrapper buffers incoming elements. This is a Lucene.NET EXPERIMENTAL API, use at your own risk DocumentDictionary Dictionary with terms, weights, payload (optional) and contexts (optional) information taken from stored/indexed fields in a Lucene index. NOTE: The term and (optionally) payload fields have to be stored The weight field can be stored or can be a NumericDocValues . If the weight field is not defined, the value of the weight is 0 if any of the term or (optionally) payload fields supplied do not have a value for a document, then the document is skipped by the dictionary DocumentDictionary.DocumentInputEnumerator Implements IInputEnumerator from stored fields. DocumentValueSourceDictionary Dictionary with terms and optionally payload information taken from stored fields in a Lucene index. Similar to DocumentDictionary , except it obtains the weight of the terms in a document based on a Lucene.Net.Queries.Function.ValueSource . NOTE: The term and (optionally) payload fields have to be stored if the term or (optionally) payload fields supplied do not have a value for a document, then the document is rejected by the dictionary In practice the Lucene.Net.Queries.Function.ValueSource will likely be obtained using the lucene expression module. The following example shows how to create a Lucene.Net.Queries.Function.ValueSource from a simple addition of two fields: Expression expression = JavascriptCompiler.Compile(\"f1 + f2\"); SimpleBindings bindings = new SimpleBindings(); bindings.Add(new SortField(\"f1\", SortField.Type_e.LONG)); bindings.Add(new SortField(\"f2\", SortField.Type_e.LONG)); ValueSource valueSource = expression.GetValueSource(bindings); FileDictionary Dictionary represented by a text file. Format allowed: 1 entry per line: An entry can be: suggestion suggestion Lucene.Net.Search.Suggest.FileDictionary.fieldDelimiter weight suggestion Lucene.Net.Search.Suggest.FileDictionary.fieldDelimiter weight Lucene.Net.Search.Suggest.FileDictionary.fieldDelimiter payload where the default Lucene.Net.Search.Suggest.FileDictionary.fieldDelimiter is DEFAULT_FIELD_DELIMITER (a tab) NOTE: In order to have payload enabled, the first entry has to have a payload If the weight for an entry is not specified then a value of 1 is used A payload cannot be specified without having the weight specified for an entry If the payload for an entry is not specified (assuming payload is enabled) then an empty payload is returned An entry cannot have more than two Lucene.Net.Search.Suggest.FileDictionary.fieldDelimiter s Example: word1 word2 TAB 100 TAB payload1 word3 TAB 101 word4 word3 TAB 102 InMemorySorter An IBytesRefSorter that keeps all the entries in memory.
