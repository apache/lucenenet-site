There are 3 main highlighters: <xref:Lucene.Net.Search.Highlight> - A lightweight highlighter for basic usage. <xref:Lucene.Net.Search.PostingsHighlight> (In the <xref:Lucene.Net.ICU> package) - Highlighter implementation that uses offsets from postings lists. This highlighter supports Unicode. <xref:Lucene.Net.Search.VectorHighlight> - This highlighter is fast for large docs, supports N-gram fields, multi-term highlighting, colored highlight tags, and more. There is a <xref:Lucene.Net.Search.VectorHighlight.BreakIteratorBoundaryScanner> in the <xref:Lucene.Net.ICU> package that can be added on for Unicode support."
