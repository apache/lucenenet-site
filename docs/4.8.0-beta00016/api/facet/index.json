Add <xref:Lucene.Net.Facet.FacetField> or <xref:Lucene.Net.Facet.Taxonomy.AssociationFacetField> to your documents at index time to use taxonomy-based methods. Sorted-set doc values method does not require a separate taxonomy index, and computes counts based on sorted set doc values fields (<xref:Lucene.Net.Facet.SortedSet.SortedSetDocValuesFacetCounts>). Add <xref:Lucene.Net.Facet.SortedSet.SortedSetDocValuesFacetField> to your documents at index time to use sorted set facet counts. Range faceting <xref:Lucene.Net.Facet.Range.Int64RangeFacetCounts>, <xref:Lucene.Net.Facet.Range.DoubleRangeFacetCounts> compute counts for a dynamic numeric range from a provided <xref:Lucene.Net.Queries.Function.ValueSource> (previously indexed numeric field, or a dynamic expression such as distance). At search time you first run your search, but pass a <xref:Lucene.Net.Facet.FacetsCollector> to gather all hits (and optionally, scores for each hit). Then, instantiate whichever facet methods you'd like to use to compute aggregates. Finally, all methods implement a common <xref:Lucene.Net.Facet.Facets> base API that you use to obtain specific facet counts. The various FacetsCollector.Search() utility methods are useful for doing an \"ordinary\" search (sorting by score, or by a specified Sort) but also collecting into a <xref:Lucene.Net.Facet.FacetsCollector> for subsequent faceting."
